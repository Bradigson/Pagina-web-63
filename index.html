                <h2>What is the moon</h2>
                <p>The Moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth. With an equatorial diameter of 3476 km, it is the fifth largest satellite in the solar system, while in terms of proportional size with respect to its planet it is the largest satellite: a quarter of the diameter of the Earth and 1/81 of its mass. After Io, it is also the second densest satellite. It is in synchronous relationship with the Earth, always showing the same face towards the planet. The visible hemisphere is marked with dark lunar seas of volcanic origin between the bright ancient mountains and the prominent astroblems.<br><br>

                Despite being, in appearance, the brightest object in the sky after the Sun, its surface is actually very dark, with a reflection similar to that of coal. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have made the Moon an object with important cultural influence since ancient times both in language, calendar, art or mythology. The gravitational influence of the Moon produces the tides and increases the length of the day. The orbital distance of the Moon, about thirty times the diameter of the Earth, makes it appear in the sky the same size as the Sun and allows the Moon to cover exactly the Sun in total solar eclipses.<br><br>
                    
                The Moon is the only celestial body in which the human being has made a manned descent. Although the Soviet Union's Moon program was the first to reach the Moon with an unmanned spacecraft, the United States' Apollo program conducted the only manned missions to the Earth satellite to date, beginning with the first manned lunar orbit by Apollo. 8 in 1968, and six manned moon landings between 1969 and 1972, the first being Apollo 11 in 1969, and the last Apollo 17. These missions returned with more than 380 kg of lunar rock, which have allowed a detailed geological understanding of the origins of the Moon (believed to have formed 4.5 billion years ago after a major impact), the formation of its internal structure, and its subsequent history.</p>

                       <p>The blood moon prophecies are a series of prophecies in the Bible which, according to Christian preachers John Hagee and Mark Biltz, state that a tetrad (a series of four consecutive lunar eclipses—all total and coinciding on Jewish holidays—with six full moons in between, and no intervening partial lunar eclipses) which began with the April 2014 lunar eclipse is the beginning of the end times as described in the Bible in the Book of Joel, Acts 2:20, and Revelation 6:12. The tetrad ended with the lunar eclipse on September 27–28, 2015.</p>

                    <p>The crescent represents divinity and sovereignty. It is the symbol of Islam and a clear example is its representation on the flags of all Islamic countries. Africana: Time and Death. But in some tribes they associate it with trees, and in others it means a male deity.</p>

                       <p>The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days. During each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period. That said, 59% of the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth through shifts in perspective due to libration.[17]</p>
